I still remember my first day‚Ä¶ we were both waiting at the same bus stop for the college bus, but I didn‚Äôt notice you. Even after college started, I didn‚Äôt notice you much. You were just a classmate I had heard about, but we never talked.

Then, in our second year,  we ended up going to a few places together. That‚Äôs when I started noticing you more. You were this introverted guy‚Ä¶ quiet, calm. But somehow, we became friends. Not just friends ‚Äî close friends.

People around us started teasing, calling us ‚Äúbetter halves‚Äù‚Ä¶ and honestly, our bond kept growing. We were spending so much time together, and I didn‚Äôt even realize how important you were becoming to me.

And then, one day ‚Äî I‚Äôll never forget ‚Äî we were watching The End of the F**ing World*. You kissed me. And I didn‚Äôt stop you. We kissed‚Ä¶ and then you told me you loved me.

I didn‚Äôt say anything right away. That weekend, we both went home‚Ä¶ and suddenly I found myself missing you like crazy. There was so much confusion, so many thoughts running in my head. We were both scared ‚Äî what if we lose our friendship?

That whole weekend, we chatted non-stop‚Ä¶ almost 24 hours a day. And when we came back to college after the weekend, I told you‚Ä¶
I love you.

That was the beginning ‚Äî July 18, 2022 ‚Äî the day our love story truly started.

You are the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.
Through so many ups and downs, countless fights and disagreements, we are still here ‚Äî together. And I‚Äôm happy for us. üíï`;

Hi Nethul KK,

I want to thank you for being in my life for so long. I hope we can sort things out and work on everything together. I'm really glad I found you, baby boo.

It's been three years ‚Äî you've tolerated me, loved me, and annoyed me üòÑ. You're so funny, baby. I love you more than anything, and you're my everything.

I want to let you know that I‚Äôll always be by your side ‚Äî good or bad, no matter what. I‚Äôll be there for you. And I hope we can achieve the things we dreamed of. Everything will get better, and we‚Äôll be happy, baby.

I love you Very Much, baby.
Happy Anniversary again!

Forever yours,  
Suvarna ‚ù§Ô∏è
